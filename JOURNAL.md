# July 11th: PCB Design

The day before Undercity, I decided to prime my PCB design skills (that was my role on our team) by building a fun little hacker card (I also had an odd point value, so this would be helpful). I had heard of them through their increasing popularity on the slack, but I didn't know much about them. Turns out, the electronic NFC contact card was a really cool idea that I had been thinking of for weeks, and here was my opportunity to build one.

I found this helpful tutorial on how to do it: https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/hacker-card

It initially took me a long time to research and make the PCB since I wanted to do it in KiCad instead of EasyEDA, which the tutorial used. Eventually, after an hour of frustratingly trying to find the right parts and wiring for other NFC tags, I settled instead for doing what the article recommended.

The silkscreen design was, of course, my favorite part. I really enjoyed the aesthetic design part and wanted it to look as polished as possible. See below!

# July 15th: Ordering, BOM, etc.

I finished my project after Undercity by generating the gerber files and wrapping up some details on the PCB design. I made my BOM, journal (here!), and readme, and I also decided to create a JLCPCB order (not ordering it yet) just to see what the price would be. I knew I wanted PCBA since I wanted a lot of cards without having to assemble the small pieces myself. However, PCBA was being really difficult today and messed up my quantity of parts, which ended up giving me a $70 price tag. I knew there was probably no way it could cost that much, but it was also 4AM and I decided to leave it for another day, after I got the project approved.

Why is JLCPCB randomly making only some of my parts 4x quantity ðŸ˜­
